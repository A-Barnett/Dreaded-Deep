# Dreaded Deep
This game was made for the [NUGDS Winter Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/game-dev-winter-jam-25) using Unreal Engine 5

Dreaded Deep is a small exploration focused game, with a dark and suffocating atmosphere as you are trapped at the bottom of the ocean. 
You must find and retrieve all the artefacts hidden around the environment, but it wonâ€™t be that simple. With limited oxygen supply and a hungry shark on the prowl, can you bring back all the artifacts in one piece?
